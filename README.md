We collected customer feedback data and ingested it into Microsoft Fabric. Using Python (Pandas), we cleaned and preprocessed the data, handling missing values and preparing text for sentiment analysis. With NLP models (using NLTK) and Mlflow tracking models , we classified reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

We visualized insights using Power BI, creating interactive dashboards![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad5aabf6-b28e-4dee-8c15-2a04c5757a40)
